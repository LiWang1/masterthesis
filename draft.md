#Draft for Master Thesis
## What's Automatic differentiation
* It's a transformation of algorithms for functions into functions for their derivatives;
* It's kind of partially symbolic and partially numerical
* Apply symbolic differentiation at the elementary level, and keep intermediate numerical results, in lock step with the evaluation of the main function.
* It would be nice to mention difference between AD and symbolic differentiation and finite difference method.

## Environmental models available
1, Linear regression model
2, Batch reactor model
3, The nitrification model from the paper from Chris
4, Conceptual model + the MOD2 from the urban drainage course

## Performance metric (suggestions)
1, Accuracy
2, Run time and memory
3, Applicability
4, Ease of implementation and readability

## Scale of the complexibility
1, the #para
2, linear regression -> ANN -> ODE -> SWMM(MOD2) -> PDE
